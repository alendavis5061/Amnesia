The AES Encryption algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block/chunk size of 128 bits. It converts these individual blocks using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Once it encrypts these blocks, it joins them together to form the ciphertext.

It is based on a substitution-permutation network, also known as an SP network. It consists of a series of linked operations, including replacing inputs with specific outputs (substitutions) and others involving bit shuffling (permutations).

In this tutorial, you will go through some of the standout features that AES offers as a globally standardized encryption algorithm. 

What are the Features of AES?
SP Network: It works on an SP network structure rather than a Feistel cipher structure, as seen in the case of the DES algorithm.
Key Expansion: It takes a single key up during the first stage, which is later expanded to multiple keys used in individual rounds.
Byte Data: The AES encryption algorithm does operations on byte data instead of bit data. So it treats the 128-bit block size as 16 bytes during the encryption procedure.
Key Length: The number of rounds to be carried out depends on the length of the key being used to encrypt data. The 128-bit key size has ten rounds, the 192-bit key size has 12 rounds, and the 256-bit key size has 14 rounds.
